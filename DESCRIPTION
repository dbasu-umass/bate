Description: A package for computing bounds for the treatment effect 
    after adjusting for the presence of omitted variables in linear  
    econometric models. You supply the data, identify the outcome and 
    treatment variables and additional regressors. The main functions
    will compute bounds for the bias-adjusted treatment effect. Many
    plot functions allow easy visualization of results.
